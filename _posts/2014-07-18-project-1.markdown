		<h3>Do you need 'design' help?</h3>
		<p>Want to improve an existing product or service? Been told you need to 'get to know your users'? Not sure how to gauge what your users like and dislike? Do you have an idea, but no clue where to start?</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Yep - it sounds like you could use some help with user research, conceptual design, or UX strategy.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Think of <strong><a href="#">design</a></strong> as a problem-solving process. Good design can help you ask the right questions, find good information, and make great decisions that focus on your users needs, motivations and limitations. Take a look at the work I've done, or <a href="#"> contact me </a> to discuss your company's needs.

		<h4 class="dark">Summary</h4>
		<p>HD Plus had created a game-changing dialysis machine for self-care and was seeking to lower the cost to patients by creating a <strong>tablet-based, self-guided training experience</strong>.</p>
		<p>Their challenge? Make the device’s first handshake welcoming, safe, and teach necessary skills and information to a largely non-technical audience.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-lg-6">
		<h4 class="dark">My Role</h4>
		<p>I joined the project to perform <strong>user research</strong> and <strong>analysis</strong>, create the first <strong>conceptual designs</strong> for the training experience, and <strong>prototype</strong> potential features and functionality.</p>
	</div>

<br />

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-lg-6">
		<h4 class="dark">The Work</h4>
		<p>I worked with company stakeholders and medical professionals to determine <strong>product and business requirements</strong>. Then I performed extensive <strong>research, analysis</strong> and <strong>prototyping </strong>with our users to figure out:</p>
		<br />
		<ul>
			<li>what could motivate you to try self-care hemodialysis?</li>
			<li>what do you fear about self-care, and how can we address it?</li>
			<li>how do you best learn and retain information about your health? </li>
		</ul>

		<br />
		<h4 class="dark">Outcomes & Deliverables</h4>
		<p>I analyzed the interviews and prototype data to produce novel insights and useful tools for HDPlus to use in future work, like: <strong>user personas</strong>, <strong>usability requirements</strong>, and <strong>interaction ‘building blocks’</strong> to package educational content.</p>

		<p>Along the way a few other cool outcomes snuck in, like a completely new way to look at <strong>marketing</strong> the device, and some educational <strong>content design</strong>. I also facilitated a <strong>product handoff and creative session</strong> to kick off collaboration between HDPlus and their outside mobile development and branding firms.</p>

		<h4 class="dark">Summary</h4>
		<p>In the aftermath of an EF3 tornado in my hometown, I co-founded, designed and managed <a href="http://recovers.org">Recovers.org</a>, an award winning <strong>disaster relief platform</strong> designed to help neighbors handle the resources that pour into their communities after disasters. Our software has been <strong>recognized internationally</strong> for improving the speed and efficiency of local disaster recovery. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-lg-6">
		<h4 class="dark">My Role</h4>
		<p>There's no better way to create great software than on the ground with your users - I spent weeks in disaster areas, <strong>working with survivors to co-design solutions</strong> to the problems they faced. I led the initial <strong>product design</strong> and <strong>field-work</strong>, and  <strong>assembled and managed our team</strong> of engineers and designers through our first several years of development.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-lg-6">
		<br />
		<h4 class="dark">Outcomes</h4>
		<p>Our platform helped hundreds of thousands of people connect to local recovery, from NYC after Hurricane Sandy to Moore, OK after an EF5 tornado. I recieved a Champion of Change award from the US White House in 2013 for these contributions to the field of disaster recovery. </p></p>
